# sensenet Compatibility pack
This repo contains legacy code and content used by sensenet installations that were upgraded from sensenet 6 to 7.

> The package and code here is relevant only for **upgraded portals**. Instances that started as a clean sensenet 7 application should not install this component.

The artifacts available here are maintained by the community and are published only to let 3rd party developers maintain and upgrade old sites.
